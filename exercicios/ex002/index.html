    <h1>Paragraphs and Line breaks</h1>  
    <hr> 
    <p>You can write a paragraph in any way you like as long as everything is encompassed in between &lt;p&gt; and &lt;/p&gt; tags. In case you need to break the line (or break the row), use the &lt;br&gt; tag as in <br> this example <br> here. <!--inserimos aí nesse parágrafo 2 quebras de linha-->
    </p> 
    <hr>
    <p>So now it's time to learn some special characters:<br>&reg; &rarr; & reg ; (without spaces) <br> &copy; &rarr; & copy ; (without spaces) <br> &trade; &rarr; & trade ; (without spaces) <br> &euro; &rarr; & euro ; (without spaces) <br> &pound; &rarr; & pound ; (without spaces) </p>
    <hr>
    <p>Now let's add Emojis: <br> First, access <a href="emojipedia.org">emojipedia.org</a>, search and select your emoji. <br> After that, scroll down the page until the Codepoints menu. Copy the code ignoring the U+ part, type &#x immediately followed by the code you copied (paste it right there) and the ; character <br> Like this: &#x1F308; </p>
